*Serves 8*

### Ingredients

**Crust**

- 2 cups graham crackers (crushed)
- 1 stick melted butter
- 1/2 cup sugar

**Filling**

- 3 egg yolks (set whites aside)
- 1 can sweetened condensed milk
- Juice of 3 lemons

**Meringue**

- 3 egg whites
- 1/4 tsp. cream of tartar
- 1/4 cup sugar


### Preparation

**To make the crust:**

- Heat the oven to 325°F.
- Break the graham crackers into small pieces and place in the bowl of a food processor along with the sugar and salt.
- Pulse 8 times, until the cracker crumbs are semi-fine (they shouldn't be powdery but not in large shards either) and the crackers and sugar are combined.
- Pour in the butter and pulse until the butter is blended in and the mixture isn't crumbly and holds its shape when you squeeze it, about twelve 1-second pulses.
- Transfer the crust to a 9-inch springform pan and push and press the crumb mixture into the bottom and two-thirds of the way up the sides of the pan. Use the bottom of a measuring cup to press the crust into place. Set aside.


**To make the filling:**

- Whisk the condensed milk with the lemon juice and set aside.
- Whisk the zest with the egg yolks in a medium bowl until pale, 30 to 60 seconds, and then whisk in the lemon juice-condensed milk mixture.

- Place the springform pan on a rimmed baking sheet, pour the mixture into the crust, and carefully transfer the baking sheet to the oven.
- Bake until the center jiggles slightly, like a soft-setting custard, about 25 minutes.
- Remove from the oven and cool for 1 hour on a cooling rack. Loosely cover the pan with plastic wrap (be careful not to let the plastic wrap touch the top of the pie) and freeze for at least 6 hours or overnight.
