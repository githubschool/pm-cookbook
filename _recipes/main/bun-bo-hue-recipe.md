Ingredients:

1 1/2 pounds beef shank
2 pounds beef bones (shin bones and marrow bones)
2 red onions, peeled, one left whole, the other sliced for garnish
5 stalks lemongrass (see how to prepare fresh lemongrass)
1/4 fresh pineapple, peeled (see tips on how to cut a pineapple)
thumb-size knob of fresh ginger, smashed (no need to peel)
4 tablespoons Quoc Viet bun bo hue seasoning
1 thumb-size piece of rock sugar (or to taste)
kosher salt (to taste)
1 tablespoon chile saute oil (more to taste)
fish sauce (to taste)
fermented shrimp paste (to taste)
1 small head cabbage, purple or green, thinly sliced (on a mandoline if you have one)
1 bunch scallions or green onions, sliced
1 bunch cilantro and/or basil (Thai basil if you can find it)
bean sprouts
lime wedges
fresh chilies, sliced
extra-large vermicelli noodles (labeled for “bun bo”)
sliced cha lua (Vietnamese ham/pork roll); if you have trouble finding it and are up for another project, make your own

Instructions:

1. Fill Instant Pot with 2 liters water (or about 8 1/2 cups) and beef bones. Set to saute and bring to a boil (should take about 20 minutes) and boil bones for 15-20 minutes to remove impurities. Discard water, rinse the boiled bones and the pot to remove any scum, and place cleaned bones back into pot.

2. Remove outer layers and tough bottoms and tops of lemongrass. Discard or compost the trimmings, then use the back of a heavy knife or a mallet to smash stalks so they’ll infuse more flavor into the broth. Fold them in half if too long to fit into your pot (you can also tie the stalks together with kitchen twine if you have it, to make it easier to fish them out at the end). Add them to the Instant Pot.

3. Add the whole peeled red onion, peeled piece of pineapple, smashed ginger, Quoc Viet seasoning, rock sugar, and 2 tablespoons kosher salt to pot. Fill with fresh water to max line on Instant Pot.

4. Lock on lid, make sure valve is set to sealing, and set Instant Pot to manual high pressure for 30 minutes. When it’s done, protect your hand with a heavy oven mitt or kitchen towels, and turn valve to venting to quick release pressure.

5. Add the beef shank to the pot and submerge completely to prevent darkening. Cook for another 15 minutes on manual high pressure, then quick release.

6. Remove beef shank and thinly slice. Set aside.

7. Remove lemongrass, pineapple, onion, ginger, and bones from broth. Discard or compost them. Add enough water to bring the liquid level up to max line and taste for seasoning; adjust with salt (and/or fish sauce), shrimp paste, chile oil, and/or more sugar if necessary. The flavors should be balanced, but everything is also meant to be to your taste.

8. Boil vermicelli according to package directions, then drain and rinse in cold water to stop cooking. This also gives them a little bounce.

9. To assemble your bun bo hue, use tongs or a strainer to portion noodles into shallow bowls. Layer your desired protein (including the sliced beef shank and sliced Vietnamese ham, if using) and veggie garnishes (onions, cabbage, chilies, bean sprouts, scallions, and/or herbs) on top.

10. Ladle the hot broth over each bowl. Serve with lime wedges.

If cooking on the stove, plan on simmering the bones to make the broth for several hours (add the beef shank in the last two hours, then remove, slice it, and set aside before you finish seasoning the broth).
